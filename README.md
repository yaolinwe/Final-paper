Methodological information:
    The team members started with a meeting. They were each allocated to their groups and given the required materials. The instructions were written on a sheet and each student was given a sheet. The instructions were read loud and the ununderstandable points were explained. The participants were given the rules to be followed during the interview. Two days after the initial meeting, participants were informed of their group assignment and its condition and reminded that, if they were in a food-deprived group, they should not eat anything after 10 a.m. the next day. Participants from the control group were tested at 7:30 p.m. in a designated computer lab on the day the deprivation started. Those in the 12-hour group were tested at 10 p.m. on that same day. Those in the 24-hour group were tested at 10:40 a.m. on the following day. 
The team that were to interview the patients gave them the available questionnaires. The medical providers were interviewed by different team members. Some of the team members went through the clinical records. The other team members observed the handling of patients as they were being treated asking the medical practitioners questions. In addition, they were told that they would have an unlimited amount of time to complete the task, and they were not to tell any other participant whether they had completed the questionnaire or they had simply given up. This procedure was followed to prevent the group influence of some participants seeing others give up. Any participant still working on the questionnaire after 40 minutes was stopped so that we could keep the time of the study manageable. Immediately after each participant stopped working on the questionnaire, he/she gave demographic information and completed a few manipulation-check items.
